# Progress log

## 2026-08-14

**Artifacts staged.** Downloaded and byte-verified against the HF API at pinned
revisions (0 size mismatches, 0 missing across 121 files / 156.5 GB):
`Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B@6a9e13bd`, `nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4@0893e160`,
`Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B@1d4bf0f2`, `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4@9c73e2da`. Stored on the
777 GB overlay at `/var/tmp/models` (the durable 100 GB volume cannot hold all
four); the overlay is container-local, so a rebuild means re-downloading.

**Reference recipes measured**, not read off cards — see
[docs/01-nvfp4-composition.md](docs/01-nvfp4-composition.md). Both vendors
4-bit only the MLP and keep attention at 8-bit; both keep the vision tower BF16.

**Recipe fixed** — [docs/02-recipe-k4.md](docs/02-recipe-k4.md). MLP K4,
attention BF16-on-disk for runtime K6, `lm_head` K6, MTP K6, embed/vision BF16.
18.75 GB VRAM vs NVIDIA's 21.92 GB, with the headroom exchange rates recorded
for a later `down_proj` promotion.

**Runtime contract established** — [docs/03-gg-runtime-contract.md](docs/03-gg-runtime-contract.md).
Four findings that change the plan: no Qwen `MODEL_FAMILY` (bypass the
launchers, call `vllm serve` directly), `--enforce-eager` is mandatory for a
dense EXL3 checkpoint, `--quantization exl3` must be explicit, and the
online-K6 `ignore` list must be written from scratch or the overlay will claim
the vision tower and silently degrade it to MXFP8.

**Toolchain gaps identified** — [docs/04-exllamav3-toolchain.md](docs/04-exllamav3-toolchain.md).
exllamav3 supports this architecture first-class but has no per-module bit
override and cannot emit BF16 for a decoder linear, so the plan is convert-then-splice.

**Baselines proven** — [docs/06-baseline-validation.md](docs/06-baseline-validation.md).
No container runtime is available (seccomp denies user/mount namespaces), so the
r34 image was pulled with an unprivileged OCI puller and is run through `proot`.
Both `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` and BF16 `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` serve and answer
requests under the official image, at full GPU speed.

### Next

1. K4 conversion inside the image rootfs (its exllamav3 and prebuilt SM120
   `exl3_gemm` extension are the same ones the runtime loads).
2. Splice BF16 attention, regenerate index + `quantization_config.json`.
3. Serve with `--quantization exl3 --enforce-eager` and the Qwen `ignore` list.
4. KLD against the BF16 teacher, with the NVFP4 quant as control.
5. Publish `malaiwah/Qwen3.8-27B-K4`.
